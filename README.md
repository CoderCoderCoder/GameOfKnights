# Foragers: Where genetic algorithms meet strategy
## The idea
What if soldiers, mages and barbarians learn from their mistakes? What if technicians understand
what things they can copy with? What if generations over
generations your army learns how to act and react in different setting, helped by your
guidance, but acting on their free will? 

This is what *Foragers* is all about. Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms in
a strategy game, where you reach out to expand your territory in a variety of challenging
maps.

## The roadmap (no dates attached!)
* Create basic game entities/classes - v0.1
* Create basic interactions: fight 1vs1 for soldiers/towers - v0.1
* Create basic map rendering (console) - v0.2
* Create basic abilities - v0.2
* Create a basic economy - v0.2
* Create a game emulator (console) - v0.2
* Define the genome for the population (and other genetic algorithms parameters)
* Run emulator with the Genetic Algorithm to balance
* Determine user intervention levels to genetic traits (i.e. soldier training)
* Create map generators
* Use graphics rendering
* Create UI
* Gametest till we drop...
